\## 1. What this document is



This file states the PLMRS concept as a \*\*testable engineering claim\*\* in measurable terms.



It is intended to:

\- give researchers a clean “what to test” target,

\- avoid accidental drift into construction guidance,

\- preserve the repo’s professional and liability boundaries.



It is \*\*not\*\* a design spec, not construction documentation, and not site-specific guidance.



\* \* \*



\## 2. Critical scope declaration



> PLMRS is presented as a conceptual and research-oriented engineering synthesis.

>

> This document defines a testable hypothesis only.

> It does NOT provide:

> - sizing methods

> - install details

> - drawings

> - materials specifications

> - code compliance claims

> - safety guarantees

>

> Any evaluation, modification, testing, or deployment is undertaken solely by the implementing party, who assumes full responsibility for compliance with applicable laws, codes, standards, and safety requirements.

\## 3. The testable hypothesis (measurable claim)



A \*\*distributed, foundation-embedded inertial array\*\* with structured coupling (detuning and phase relationship across elements) can reduce damaging resonance amplification pathways compared to an appropriate baseline foundation condition under representative seismic excitation.



Operational restatement:

\- If resonant energy is \*\*absorbed / scattered / de-phased\*\* before it coherently builds into damaging modes,

\- then peak structural demands may be reduced relative to baseline for the same excitation set.



This is a claim about \*\*response shaping\*\*, not a claim of universal safety.



\* \* \*



\## 4. What “success” means (evaluation outcomes)



The claim is supported only if controlled study shows improvements \*\*relative to baseline\*\* (explicitly defined by the evaluator) such as:



\- reduced peak acceleration transfer into the superstructure,

\- reduced amplification near targeted modal bands,

\- reduced drift demand (for comparable input motions),

\- reduced concentration of energy in damaging modal channels.



All reported outcomes should include:

\- baseline definition,

\- motion set definition,

\- sensitivity / robustness notes (parameter drift, uncertainty).



\* \* \*



\## 5. What this document does not claim



This file does not claim:

\- novelty over prior art,

\- suitability for any specific site, soil class, or structure type,

\- replacement of base isolation, damping systems, or licensed judgment.



Publication of conceptual material is a contribution to open engineering discussion, not professional service.



\* \* \*



\## 6. Safety boundary rule (hard line)



PLMRS must not be implemented in occupied structures based on this repository.



Any pursuit beyond concept requires qualified professional oversight and appropriate validation as outlined in:

\- `docs/PLMRS\_Validation\_Ladder\_v1.0.md`

\- `docs/PLMRS\_Open\_Release\_and\_Liability\_v1.0.md`
