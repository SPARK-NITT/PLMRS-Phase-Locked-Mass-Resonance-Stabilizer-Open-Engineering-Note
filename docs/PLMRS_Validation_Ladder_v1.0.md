\## 1. What this document is



This file defines a \*\*gated validation pathway\*\* for any party who chooses to advance PLMRS beyond concept.



It exists to:

\- prevent “concept-to-field” misuse,

\- force responsible sequencing (model → bench → lab → independent replication),

\- keep liability and professional boundaries explicit.



This is not a design protocol. It is a STOP/GO ladder.



\* \* \*



\## 2. Non-negotiable rule



\*\*No implementation in occupied structures\*\* based on this repository.



If PLMRS is pursued beyond concept, responsibility and authority reside with the implementing professional parties.

\## 3. The ladder (gates + STOP conditions)



\### Gate 0 — Concept framing (this repo)

Minimum:

\- clear testable claim

\- explicit non-claims

\- explicit “no occupied deployment” boundary



STOP if:

\- anyone treats repo material as construction guidance.



\### Gate 1 — Numerical feasibility

Minimum:

\- baseline definition

\- excitation set definition

\- comparative results (time-history / transfer functions)

\- sensitivity to parameter drift / uncertainty



STOP if:

\- performance collapses under small variance,

\- response worsens under common motion families,

\- the concept requires unrealistic tolerances to behave.



\### Gate 2 — Benchtop demonstrator

Minimum:

\- instrumented measurements

\- repeatability across trials

\- documented failure modes



STOP if:

\- effects are non-repeatable,

\- outcomes depend on uncontrolled artifacts,

\- unstable / amplifying behavior emerges.



\### Gate 3 — Lab-grade validation (shake table or equivalent)

Minimum:

\- multiple excitation inputs

\- uncertainty bounds

\- documented test plan and instrumentation



STOP if:

\- broadband inputs erase gains,

\- new damaging modes are introduced,

\- failure behavior is brittle or unsafe.



\### Gate 4 — Independent replication

Minimum:

\- second-party replication with their own apparatus and reporting



STOP if:

\- independent replication fails or yields net-negative outcomes.



\### Gate 5 — Non-occupied pilot context (only after Gates 1–4)

Minimum:

\- monitoring plan

\- durability / aging considerations

\- inspection and maintenance requirements stated explicitly



STOP if:

\- maintenance demands are unrealistic,

\- degradation introduces unacceptable uncertainty,

\- any unsafe behavior is observed.



\### Gate 6 — Professional compliance pathway (implementation domain)

Minimum:

\- engineer-of-record involvement

\- jurisdictional code pathway analysis

\- safety/compliance strategy



STOP if:

\- no lawful pathway exists,

\- performance cannot be assessed reliably in licensed practice.

\## 4. Responsibility boundary (clarity)



This repository provides:

\- conceptual hypothesis framing,

\- non-normative validation gating language,

\- licensing and liability posture.



This repository does not provide:

\- design parameters,

\- construction documentation,

\- installation guidance,

\- suitability determinations.



All responsibility remains with the implementing engineer(s) and organization(s).
